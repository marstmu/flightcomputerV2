# flightcomputerV2

Basic placeholder script that implements high and low speed data collection depending on a certain acceleration threshold, this will let the flight computer collect data at a higher rate only when the rocket launches to conserve battery while at rest

This code is meant to be used with micropython

(also test print scripts for components)
